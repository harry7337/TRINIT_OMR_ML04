Submission from Team OMR for the TRI-NIT Hackathon
Problem Statement:
ML04
Forecasting stock market prices have always been a challenging task
for many business analyst and researchers. Your friend, who is
interested in investing in the stock market shares of the well-known
company IBM is unable to predict the company's stock market. The
rate of his investment and his business opportunities in IBM's
Stockmarket can increase if an efficient algorithm could be
devised to predict the short term price of an individual stock.

Objectives:
The link below contains a dataset, where the
TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED give the stock
market's close value of every day with a date. Your task
is to devise a model to predict the 'adjusted close' value
of the next day given the stocks of all days until the
current day, and developer a front-end UI (either Web
app or Mobile app) that can help your friend invest the
right amount of money
